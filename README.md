## Army Painter

This project pays homage to my favourite IP of all time - Warhammer 40K and my favourite generic foot soldier of all time - the humble Space Marine/Astartes/Angel of Death. 

I am eternally grateful towards Bruno Simon, Joseph, Sjoerd and the entire Poimandres community whose help and support (including the development of R3F and Drei) were critical to making this app.

Note, the project is not done yet and I will add more props to the environment(as well as restructure my code base + refactor to TS). Stay tuned!
